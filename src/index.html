            <h1>The Awful German Language <span>(by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain">Mark Twain</a>)</span></h1>
            <blockquote>A little learning makes the whole world kin.<br> -- <cite>Proverbs</cite> xxxii, 7.
            </blockquote>

            <p>I went often to look at the collection of curiosities in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg_Castle">Heidelberg Castle</a>, and one day I surprised the keeper of it with my German. I spoke entirely in that language. He was greatly
                interested; and after I had talked a while he said my German was very rare, possibly a &quot;unique&quot;; and wanted to add it to his museum.
            </p>

            <p>If he had known what it had cost me to acquire my art, he would also have known that it would break any collector to buy it. Harris and I had been hard at work on our German during several weeks at that time, and although we had made good
                progress, it had been accomplished under great difficulty and annoyance, for three of our teachers had died in the mean time. A person who has not studied German can form no idea of what a perplexing language it is.
            </p>

            <p>Surely there is not another language that is so slipshod and systemless, and so slippery and elusive to the grasp. One is washed about in it, hither and thither, in the most helpless way; and when at last he thinks he has captured a rule which
                offers firm ground to take a rest on amid the general rage and turmoil of the ten parts of speech, he turns over the page and reads, &quot;Let the pupil make careful note of the following <strong>exceptions</strong>.&quot; He runs his
                eye down and finds that there are more exceptions to the rule than instances of it. So overboard he goes again, to hunt for another Ararat and find another quicksand. Such has been, and continues to be, my experience. Every time I think
                I have got one of these four confusing &quot;cases&quot; where I am master of it, a seemingly insignificant preposition intrudes itself into my sentence, clothed with an awful and unsuspected power, and crumbles the ground from under me.
                For instance, my book inquires after a certain bird -- (it is always inquiring after things which are of no sort of consequence to anybody): &quot;Where is the bird?&quot; Now the answer to this question -- according to the book -- is
                that the bird is waiting in the blacksmith shop on account of the rain. Of course no bird would do that, but then you must stick to the book. Very well, I begin to cipher out the German for that answer. I begin at the wrong end, necessarily,
                for that is the German idea. I say to myself, &quot;<strong>Regen</strong> (rain) is masculine -- or maybe it is feminine -- or possibly neuter -- it is too much trouble to look now. Therefore, it is either <strong>der</strong> (the) Regen,
                or <strong>die</strong> (the) Regen, or <strong>das</strong> (the) Regen, according to which gender it may turn out to be when I look. In the interest of science, I will cipher it out on the hypothesis that it is masculine. Very well --
                then
                <strong>the</strong> rain is <strong>der</strong> Regen, if it is simply in the quiescent state of being <strong>mentioned</strong>, without enlargement or discussion -- Nominative case; but if this rain is lying around, in a kind of a
                general way on the ground, it is then definitely located, it is <strong>doing something</strong> -- that is,
                <strong>resting</strong> (which is one of the German grammar's ideas of doing something), and this throws the rain into the Dative case, and makes it
                <strong>dem</strong> Regen. However, this rain is not resting, but is doing something
                <strong>actively</strong>, -- it is falling -- to interfere with the bird, likely -- and this indicates <strong>movement</strong>, which has the effect of sliding it into the Accusative case and changing <strong>dem</strong> Regen into
                <strong>den</strong> Regen.&quot; Having completed the grammatical horoscope of this matter, I answer up confidently and state in German that the bird is staying in the blacksmith shop &quot;wegen (on account of) <strong>den</strong> Regen.&quot;
                Then the teacher lets me softly down with the remark that whenever the word &quot;wegen&quot; drops into a sentence, it <strong>always</strong> throws that subject into the <strong>Genitive</strong> case, regardless of consequences --
                and that therefore this bird stayed in the blacksmith shop &quot;wegen
                <strong>des</strong> Regens.&quot;</p>

            <p>N. B. -- I was informed, later, by a higher authority, that there was an &quot;exception&quot; which permits one to say &quot;wegen <strong>dem</strong> Regen&quot; in certain peculiar and complex circumstances, but that this exception is
                not extended to anything <strong>but</strong> rain.</p>

            <p>There are ten parts of speech, and they are all troublesome. An average sentence, in a German newspaper, is a sublime and impressive curiosity; it occupies a quarter of a column; it contains all the ten parts of speech -- not in regular order,
                but mixed; it is built mainly of compound words constructed by the writer on the spot, and not to be found in any dictionary -- six or seven words compacted into one, without joint or seam -- that is, without hyphens; it treats of fourteen
                or fifteen different subjects, each inclosed in a parenthesis of its own, with here and there extra parentheses which reinclose three or four of the minor parentheses, making pens within pens: finally, all the parentheses and reparentheses
                are massed together between a couple of king-parentheses, one of which is placed in the first line of the majestic sentence and the other in the middle of the last line of it --
                <strong>after which comes the VERB</strong>, and you find out for the first time what the man has been talking about; and after the verb -- merely by way of ornament, as far as I can make out -- the writer shovels in &quot;<strong>haben sind
            gewesen gehabt haben geworden sein</strong>,&quot; or words to that effect, and the monument is finished. I suppose that this closing hurrah is in the nature of the flourish to a man's signature -- not necessary, but pretty. German books are
                easy enough to read when you hold them before the looking-glass or stand on your head -- so as to reverse the construction -- but I think that to learn to read and understand a German newspaper is a thing which must always remain an impossibility
                to a foreigner.</p>

            <p>Yet even the German books are not entirely free from attacks of the Parenthesis distemper -- though they are usually so mild as to cover only a few lines, and therefore when you at last get down to the verb it carries some meaning to your
                mind because you are able to remember a good deal of what has gone before. Now here is a sentence from a popular and excellent German novel -- with a slight parenthesis in it. I will make a perfectly literal translation, and throw in the
                parenthesis-marks and some hyphens for the assistance of the reader -- though in the original there are no parenthesis-marks or hyphens, and the reader is left to flounder through to the remote verb the best way he can:</p>

            <p>&quot;But when he, upon the street, the (in-satin-and-silk-covered-now-very-unconstrained-after-the-newest-fashioned-dressed) government counselor's wife <strong>met</strong>,&quot; etc., etc. </p>

            <blockquote>1. Wenn er aber auf der Strasse der in Sammt und Seide geh&uuml;llten jetzt sehr ungenirt nach der neusten Mode gekleideten Regierungsr&auml;thin begegnet.
            </blockquote>

            <p>That is from <cite><a href="https://archive.org/details/oldmamsellessec00marlgoog">The Old Mamselle's Secret</a></cite>, by Mrs. Marlitt. And that sentence is constructed upon the most approved German model. You observe how far that verb is
                from the reader's base of operations; well, in a German newspaper they put their verb away over on the next page; and I have heard that sometimes after stringing along the exciting preliminaries and parentheses for a column or two, they
                get in a hurry and have to go to press without getting to the verb at all. Of course, then, the reader is left in a very exhausted and ignorant state.</p>

            <p>We have the Parenthesis disease in our literature, too; and one may see cases of it every day in our books and newspapers: but with us it is the mark and sign of an unpracticed writer or a cloudy intellect, whereas with the Germans it is doubtless
                the mark and sign of a practiced pen and of the presence of that sort of luminous intellectual fog which stands for clearness among these people. For surely it is <strong>not</strong> clearness -- it necessarily can't be clearness. Even
                a jury would have penetration enough to discover that. A writer's ideas must be a good deal confused, a good deal out of line and sequence, when he starts out to say that a man met a counselor's wife in the street, and then right in the
                midst of this so simple undertaking halts these approaching people and makes them stand still until he jots down an inventory of the woman's dress. That is manifestly absurd. It reminds a person of those dentists who secure your instant
                and breathless interest in a tooth by taking a grip on it with the forceps, and then stand there and drawl through a tedious anecdote before they give the dreaded jerk. Parentheses in literature and dentistry are in bad taste.</p>

            <p>The Germans have another kind of parenthesis, which they make by splitting a verb in two and putting half of it at the beginning of an exciting chapter and the <strong>other half</strong> at the end of it. Can any one conceive of anything
                more confusing than that? These things are called &quot;separable verbs.&quot; The German grammar is blistered all over with separable verbs; and the wider the two portions of one of them are spread apart, the better the author of the
                crime is pleased with his performance. A favorite one is <strong>reiste ab</strong> -- which means departed. Here is an example which I culled from a novel and reduced to English:</p>

            <blockquote>&quot;The trunks being now ready, he <strong>DE-</strong> after kissing his mother and sisters, and once more pressing to his bosom his adored Gretchen, who, dressed in simple white muslin, with a single tuberose in the ample folds of her
                rich brown hair, had tottered feebly down the stairs, still pale from the terror and excitement of the past evening, but longing to lay her poor aching head yet once again upon the breast of him whom she loved more dearly than life itself,
                <strong>PARTED</strong>.&quot;
            </blockquote>

            <p>However, it is not well to dwell too much on the separable verbs. One is sure to lose his temper early; and if he sticks to the subject, and will not be warned, it will at last either soften his brain or petrify it. Personal pronouns and adjectives
                are a fruitful nuisance in this language, and should have been left out. For instance, the same sound, <strong>sie</strong>, means
                <strong>you</strong>, and it means <strong>she</strong>, and it means <strong>her</strong>, and it means
                <strong>it</strong>, and it means <strong>they</strong>, and it means <strong>them</strong>. Think of the ragged poverty of a language which has to make one word do the work of six -- and a poor little weak thing of only three letters
                at that. But mainly, think of the exasperation of never knowing which of these meanings the speaker is trying to convey. This explains why, whenever a person says <strong>sie</strong> to me, I generally try to kill him, if a stranger.</p>

            <p>Now observe the Adjective. Here was a case where simplicity would have been an advantage; therefore, for no other reason, the inventor of this language complicated it all he could. When we wish to speak of our &quot;good friend or friends,&quot;
                in our enlightened tongue, we stick to the one form and have no trouble or hard feeling about it; but with the German tongue it is different. When a German gets his hands on an adjective, he declines it, and keeps on declining it until
                the common sense is all declined out of it. It is as bad as Latin. He says, for instance:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Singular
                    <ul>
                        <li>Nominative -- Mein gut<strong>er</strong> Freund, my good friend.</li>
                        <li>Genitives -- Mein<strong>es</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund<strong>es</strong>, of my good friend.
                        </li>
                        <li>Dative -- Mein<strong>em</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund, to my good friend.</li>
                        <li>Accusative -- Mein<strong>en</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund, my good friend.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Plural
                    <ul>
                        <li>N. -- Mein<strong>e</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund<strong>e</strong>, my good friends.</li>
                        <li>G. -- Mein<strong>er</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund<strong>e</strong>, of my good friends.
                        </li>
                        <li>D. -- Mein<strong>en</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund<strong>en</strong>, to my good friends.
                        </li>
                        <li>A. -- Mein<strong>e</strong> gut<strong>en</strong> Freund<strong>e</strong>, my good friends.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Now let the candidate for the asylum try to memorize those variations, and see how soon he will be elected. One might better go without friends in Germany than take all this trouble about them. I have shown what a bother it is to decline a
                good (male) friend; well this is only a third of the work, for there is a variety of new distortions of the adjective to be learned when the object is feminine, and still another when the object is neuter. Now there are more adjectives
                in this language than there are black cats in Switzerland, and they must all be as elaborately declined as the examples above suggested. Difficult? -- troublesome? -- these words cannot describe it. I heard a Californian student in Heidelberg
                say, in one of his calmest moods, that he would rather decline two drinks than one German adjective.</p>

            <p>The inventor of the language seems to have taken pleasure in complicating it in every way he could think of. For instance, if one is casually referring to a house, <strong>Haus</strong>, or a horse, <strong>Pferd</strong>, or a dog, <strong>Hund</strong>,
                he spells these words as I have indicated; but if he is referring to them in the Dative case, he sticks on a foolish and unnecessary <strong>e</strong> and spells them
                <strong>Hause</strong>, <strong>Pferde</strong>, <strong>Hunde</strong>. So, as an added <strong>e</strong> often signifies the plural, as the <strong>s</strong> does with us, the new student is likely to go on for a month making twins
                out of a Dative dog before he discovers his mistake; and on the other hand, many a new student who could ill afford loss, has bought and paid for two dogs and only got one of them, because he ignorantly bought that dog in the Dative singular
                when he really supposed he was talking plural -- which left the law on the seller's side, of course, by the strict rules of grammar, and therefore a suit for recovery could not lie.
            </p>

            <p>In German, all the Nouns begin with a capital letter. Now that is a good idea; and a good idea, in this language, is necessarily conspicuous from its lonesomeness. I consider this capitalizing of nouns a good idea, because by reason of it
                you are almost always able to tell a noun the minute you see it. You fall into error occasionally, because you mistake the name of a person for the name of a thing, and waste a good deal of time trying to dig a meaning out of it. German
                names almost always do mean something, and this helps to deceive the student. I translated a passage one day, which said that &quot;the infuriated tigress broke loose and utterly ate up the unfortunate fir forest&quot; (
                <strong>Tannenwald</strong>). When I was girding up my loins to doubt this, I found out that Tannenwald in this instance was a man's name.</p>

            <p>Every noun has a gender, and there is no sense or system in the distribution; so the gender of each must be learned separately and by heart. There is no other way. To do this one has to have a memory like a memorandum-book. In German, a young
                lady has no sex, while a turnip has. Think what overwrought reverence that shows for the turnip, and what callous disrespect for the girl. See how it looks in print -- I translate this from a conversation in one of the best of the German
                Sunday-school books:</p>

            <dl>
                <dt>&quot;<strong>Gretchen</strong>.</dt>
                <dd>Wilhelm, where is the turnip?</dd>
                <dt><strong>Wilhelm</strong>.</dt>
                <dd>She has gone to the kitchen.</dd>
                <dt><strong>Gretchen</strong>.</dt>
                <dd>Where is the accomplished and beautiful English maiden?
                </dd>
                <dt><strong>Wilhelm</strong>.</dt>
                <dd>It has gone to the opera.&quot;</dd>
            </dl>

            <p>To continue with the German genders: a tree is male, its buds are female, its leaves are neuter; horses are sexless, dogs are male, cats are female -- tomcats included, of course; a person's mouth, neck, bosom, elbows, fingers, nails, feet,
                and body are of the male sex, and his head is male or neuter according to the word selected to signify it, and <strong>not</strong> according to the sex of the individual who wears it -- for in Germany all the women either male heads or
                sexless ones; a person's nose, lips, shoulders, breast, hands, and toes are of the female sex; and his hair, ears, eyes, chin, legs, knees, heart, and conscience haven't any sex at all. The inventor of the language probably got what he
                knew about a conscience from hearsay.</p>

            <p>Now, by the above dissection, the reader will see that in Germany a man may
                <strong>think</strong> he is a man, but when he comes to look into the matter closely, he is bound to have his doubts; he finds that in sober truth he is a most ridiculous mixture; and if he ends by trying to comfort himself with the thought
                that he can at least depend on a third of this mess as being manly and masculine, the humiliating second thought will quickly remind him that in this respect he is no better off than any woman or cow in the land.</p>

            <p>In the German it is true that by some oversight of the inventor of the language, a Woman is a female; but a Wife (<strong>Weib</strong>) is not -- which is unfortunate. A Wife, here, has no sex; she is neuter; so, according to the grammar,
                a fish is <strong>he</strong>, his scales are <strong>she</strong>, but a fishwife is neither. To describe a wife as sexless may be called under-description; that is bad enough, but over-description is surely worse. A German speaks of
                an Englishman as the <strong>Engl&auml;nder</strong>; to change the sex, he adds
                <strong>inn</strong>, and that stands for Englishwoman -- <strong>Engl&auml;nderinn</strong>. That seems descriptive enough, but still it is not exact enough for a German; so he precedes the word with that article which indicates that
                the creature to follow is feminine, and writes it down thus: &quot;<strong>die</strong> Engl&auml;nder
                <strong>inn</strong>,&quot; -- which means &quot;the <strong>she-Englishwoman</strong>.&quot; I consider that that person is over-described.</p>

            <p>Well, after the student has learned the sex of a great number of nouns, he is still in a difficulty, because he finds it impossible to persuade his tongue to refer to things as &quot;<strong>he</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>she</strong>,&quot;
                and &quot;
                <strong>him</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>her</strong>,&quot; which it has been always accustomed to refer to it as &quot;
                <strong>it</strong>.&quot; When he even frames a German sentence in his mind, with the hims and hers in the right places, and then works up his courage to the utterance-point, it is no use -- the moment he begins to speak his tongue flies
                the track and all those labored males and females come out as &quot;
                <strong>it</strong>s.&quot; And even when he is reading German to himself, he always calls those things &quot;<strong>it</strong>,&quot; where as he ought to read in this way:</p>
